"ALL TALK AND NO FRACTION" is a web application which aims to improve its users' ability to add, subtract and simplify fractions via gamification. The user creates an avatar and his
or her progress is tracked and rewarded with experience points, awards and customization options. Questions are pulled from a database to ensure a constant level of difficulty 
throughout a given level, but the order is randomized so a level is a bit different when replayed.

Technologies chosen (as of Monday February 2nd, 2017):
- HTML and CSS
- Javascript for client-side scripting
- PHP for server-side scripting
- Postgresql database which will hold questions and answers as well as user information (username, avatar choices, progress, etc.)
- No external APIs as of yet
